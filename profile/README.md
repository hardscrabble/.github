# Hardscrabble

This GitHub Org (https://github.com/hardscrabble/) _was_ a space for code related to my blog, <https://www.hardscrabble.net>.

Did I need to make a whole org for my blog? Almost certainly not. So, I moved the repos over to my personal user:

- [hardscrabble/hardscrabble.github.io](https://github.com/hardscrabble/hardscrabble.github.io) → [maxjacobson/hardscrabble.net](https://github.com/maxjacobson/hardscrabble.net)
- [hardscrabble/comparing_mongoid_and_active_record](https://github.com/hardscrabble/comparing_mongoid_and_active_record) → [maxjacobson/comparing_mongoid_and_active_record](https://github.com/maxjacobson/comparing_mongoid_and_active_record)
- [hardscrabble/blame-game](https://github.com/hardscrabble/blame-game) → [maxjacobson/blame-game](https://github.com/maxjacobson/blame-game)

I will continue to squat on this name for now in case I come up with a good reason to use it. If I don't, I'll delete the org after a bit.

Love,  
Maxwell Jacobson
